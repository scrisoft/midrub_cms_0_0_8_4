                                    <p>Midrub Wchatbot is an app for <a href="https://codecanyon.net/item/midrub-schedule-and-publish-on-the-most-popular-social-networks/17447773" target="_blank">Midrub</a>. You can't use it without <a href="https://codecanyon.net/item/midrub-schedule-and-publish-on-the-most-popular-social-networks/17447773" target="_blank">Midrub</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The goal of this app is to help you to save potential clients and save people to
                                        find easy a response to their questions.</p>
                                    <p>Midrub Wchatbot is an app for Midrub which allows you to create a list with Quick Replies for your Whatsapp's numbers. Each reply has a list with keywords as condition for Quick Reply and you can select even the accuracy for the keywords available in the messages.</p>
                                    <p>You can connect your Whatsapp's numbers from Twilio and select one or several categories. Then, you have to select the same category or categories(at least one should be), and the bot will select the Quick Replies based on the number's categories which are used even in the Quick Replies. The bot will search for the best match and will reply. When the Midrub Wchatbot replies to a message, it saves the user as subscriber with the reply's categories and saves the conversation. You can see the subscribers and stats in both Quick Reply's page and in the History's page.</p>
                                    <p>If no Quick Replies available based on the message content, you can create a default message which will be sent to your contacts if no Quick Reply available.</p>
                                    <p>The Midrub Wchatbot app is able to identify the phone numbers and email addresses in the Whatsapp's messages. All of them will be saved in the Phone Numbers or Email Addresses pages. You can anytime see the message from where was extracted the phone number or email address. All emails and phone numbers can be exported in a CSV file.</p>
                                    <p>The Subscribers page shows the subscribers saved by the bot and you can send to them promotional messages from the Midrub Wmarketing app.</p>
                                    <p>The Audit Logs page shows in real time the bot activity. You will see the number of the replies per day and by selected Whatsapp's number. In addition, you will see the most popular Quick Replies by selected Whatsapp's number.</p>
                                    <p>Bot replies could be limit based on the plans. The Midrub Wchatbot app can be used as SAAS an your clients could use it with their Twilio's account.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>The Midrub Wchatbot app can be limited based on team's role. Each user could decide which team's members will be able to use this app.</p>

                                    <h2>About Midrub Wchatbot's Code</h2>
                                    <p>The&nbsp;Midrub Wchatbot app has a code adapted for the Midrub CMS and it follows all parameters required
                                        for a Midrub app. It has support for Midrub's api, cron jobs, ajax requests, hooks, teams, etc.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>You can translate this app in several languages and all languages directories are located in the language
                                        directory. If you want to translate it, please follow the documentation&nbsp;<a
                                            href="https://www.midrub.com/categories/translation"
                                            target="_blank">https://www.midrub.com/categories/translation</a>
                                        <a href="https://www.midrub.com/categories/translation" target="_blank"></a>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The hooks located in the directory inc allows you to configure this app in the admin panel, restrict per plan and
                                        restrict per team. You can add there even other kind of files. </p>
                                    <p>In the controllers directory you will see 3 files: user, ajax and bot. User is to display the html content to
                                        users. Ajax is to process the Ajax Requests. Bot replies to messages in messenger.</p>
                                    <p>In the directory helpers you will find all files created to manage better the code and process only required
                                        data. The helpers are based on the controllers directory's files.</p>
                                    <p>In the models directory you will find the app's models which creates the required tables in the database. I like
                                        now to use more the Midrub's Base Model for simply SQL queries but for more complex queries i'm using the app's
                                        model.</p>
                                    <p>The directory views contains the views files loaded from from the User's controller.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>In this app i've used a new library with font icons which you can find here&nbsp;<a
                                            href="https://lineicons.com/icons/" target="_blank">https://lineicons.com/icons/</a>&nbsp;This library isn't
                                        loaded from app, it is available in the Midrub User's Theme, Luna. I'm providing the theme together with the
                                        Midrub Wchatbot app. If you still want to use the Blue Theme, just add in the header from admin the link
                                        to icons.</p>

                                    <p>The categories are the most important feature because:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Them allows to manage easily the Quick Replies. You don't need to take care to asign the Quick Replies every time when you're reconnecting a Whatsapp Number.</li>
                                        <li>People which will get the Quick Reply, will be saved with the Quick Replies category and next we can use them for marketing based on the category.</li>
                                        <li>Whatsapp Numbers can be easily configured. You just have to select the categories which you've added in some Quick Replies.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The categories can be created and deleted only from the Reply's page. First of all you have to create a Quick Reply to be able to use the Categories.</p>
